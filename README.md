# Sale Prediction from Existing Customers using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict sales from existing customers using logistic regression. By analyzing customer data, the model determines the likelihood of a customer making a purchase based on their attributes.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Data Description
- The dataset consists of customer attributes such as age, salary, and purchase history. The target variable indicates whether a sale was made (1) or not (0).
- Data cleaning and preprocessing steps were applied to ensure data quality.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sale-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sale-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Sale_Prediction.ipynb` and run the cells to execute the analysis.
- Make sure to load the dataset as specified in the notebook.

## Model Evaluation
- The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and a confusion matrix.
- Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are also calculated to provide a comprehensive view of the model's effectiveness.

## Results
- The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy score of **82.5%**.
- The confusion matrix indicates the model's performance across true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
